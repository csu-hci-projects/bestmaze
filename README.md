## Egocentric and Allocentric Maze Research Project

The following project aims to create a Unity program that creates randomly generated mazes based on input parameters in order to test the effects of egocentric and allocentric perspectives and audio cues on a person's spatial localization abilities. This is a semester long project for the senior level undergraduate course CS464: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction.

### How to Run
*Make sure not to reuse participant IDs. Remind participants not to input key presses too rapidly. If you ever want to get back to the main menu, press "esc" or just restart the game.*

1. Open the project in the Unity Editor
2. Make sure that the Menu scene is selected from the Scenes folder
3. Make sure "Maximize on Play" is highlighted and "Mute Audio," "Stats," and "Gizmos" are all unhighlighted.
4. Press the play button at the middle of the top of the window
5. After an experimental trial is complete, data will be available in a .csv file in "Assets/Data Output"
